## Overview
We address the problem of ego-vehicle navigation in dense simulated traffic environments populated by road agents with varying driver behaviors. Navigation in such environments is challenging due to unpredictability in agentsâ€™ actions caused by their heterogeneous behaviors. We present a new simulation technique consisting of enriching existing traffic simulators with behavior-rich trajectories corresponding to varying levels of aggressiveness. We generate these trajectories with the help of a driver behavior modeling algorithm. We then use the enriched simulator to train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy that consists of a set of high-level vehicle control commands and use this policy at test time to perform local navigation in dense traffic. Our policy implicitly models the interactions between traffic agents and computes safe trajectories for the ego-vehicle accounting for aggressive driver maneuvers such as overtaking, over-speeding, weaving, and sudden lane changes. Our enhanced behavior-rich simulator can be used for generating datasets that consist of trajectories corresponding to diverse driver behaviors and traffic densities, and our behavior-based navigation scheme can be combined with state-of-the-art navigation algorithms.

**Offline Training** : We use a behavior-rich simulator that can generate aggressive or conservative driving styles. In Step 1,we use the CMetric behavior classification algorithm to compute a set of parameters that characterize aggressive behaviors such as overspeeding, overtaking, and sudden lane-changing. In Step 2, we use these parameters to train a behavior-based action class navigation policy for action prediction and local navigation.

**Online Training** : We use our behavior-guided trained policy and the final simulation parameters computed using offline training. During an episode at runtime, we use the trained policy to predict the next action of the ego vehicle given the current state of the traffic environment, which is represented in the form of a traffic-graph. The predicted action (in this case, \`\`turn left\'\') is converted into the final local trajectory using the internal controls of the simulator, modified by the parameters that take into account the behavior of traffic agents.

## Dependencies
```python
Python: ">=3.6"
PyTorch: ">=1.4.0"
PyTorch Geometric
TensorBoard
```

### Installing PyTorch Geometric

To install the binaries for PyTorch 1.7.0, simply run

```sh
$ pip install torch-scatter==latest+${CUDA} -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.7.0.html
$ pip install torch-sparse==latest+${CUDA} -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.7.0.html
$ pip install torch-cluster==latest+${CUDA} -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.7.0.html
$ pip install torch-spline-conv==latest+${CUDA} -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.7.0.html
$ pip install torch-geometric
```

where `${CUDA}` should be replaced by either `cpu`, `cu92`, `cu101`, `cu102`, or `cu110` and `torch-1.7.0` should be replaced by `torch-1.4.0`, `torch-1.5.0`, `torch-1.5.1`, or `torch-1.6.0` depending on your PyTorch installation.

## Usage
### Simulator Environment
- To use the behavior-rich simulator including conservative and aggressive vehicles use [master](/angmavrogiannis/B-GAP-Behavior-Guided-Action-Prediction-for-Autonomous-Navigation/tree/master) branch.
- To use the *[default](https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env)* OpenAI gym-based simulator switch to the [default_sim](/angmavrogiannis/B-GAP-Behavior-Guided-Action-Prediction-for-Autonomous-Navigation/tree/default_sim) branch. (Credits to Edouard Leurent)

### Build
First, build the code using the following commands:

```
cd highway-env/
sudo python3 setup.py install
cd ../rl-agents/
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

In case `python3` points to an older python version, either update the default python3 version, or replace `python3` with the path to the python version you intend to use.

### Training and Testing
To train the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) agent run the following command by navigating to the `rl-agents/scripts/` subdirectory:

```
python experiments.py evaluate configs/HighwayEnv/env.json configs/HighwayEnv/agents/DQNAgent/gcn.json --train --episodes=2000 --name-from-config
```

To test the GCN agent run the following command from the same directory:

```
python experiments.py evaluate configs/HighwayEnv/env.json configs/HighwayEnv/agents/DQNAgent/gcn.json --test --episodes=10 --name-from-config --recover-from=/path/to/output/folder
```

where `/path/to/output/folder` should correspond to the output file of the trained model. Trained models are saved in the subdirectory `/rl-agents/scripts/out/HighwayEnv/DQNAgent/`. Add `--no-display` to disable rendering of the environment.

To change the structure of the GCN or modify the parameters for the training, modify [gcn.json](/rl-agents/scripts/configs/HighwayEnv/agents/DQNAgent/gcn.json).

## Results
We evaluate two models -- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and GCN in dense traffic scenarios, varying the number of aggressive and conservative agents, and compare the performance of the trained GCN agent in the behavior-rich simulator and the default simulator. We apply two metrics for evaluation over 100 episodes and averaged at test time:

- **Average Speed (Avg. Spd.)** of the ego-vehicle, since it captures the distance per second covered in a varying time interval.
- **Number of lane changes (#LC)** performed by the ego-vehicle on average during the given duration. In general, fewer lane changes imply that the ego vehicle can cover the same distance with fewer maneuvers. We notice that our approach based on GCN results in approximately 50% reduction in the number of lane changes as compared to MLP.

### Advantages of Our Behavior-Rich Simulator
As the default simulator does not contain any behavior-rich trajectories, the ego-vehicle is not able to adjust its average speed and maintains a speed that is approximately the average of the average speeds obtained when operating in conservative and aggressive environments. Furthermore, the ego-vehicle does not follow a realistic lane-changing pattern in the default environment as it performs excessive number of lane changes using the MLP, but mostly follows the traffic with very few lane changes using the GCN.

### Behavior-Guided Actions
- **Conservative Traffic**: The ego-vehicle learns to confidently overtake slow-moving traffic. This reduces its average speed, but increases the number of lane changes.
- **Aggressive Traffic**: The ego-vehicle learns to act carefully around aggressive drivers, choosing to stay in the same lane. This result in fewer lane changes and safer navigation, as compared to the one observed in current AVs.
